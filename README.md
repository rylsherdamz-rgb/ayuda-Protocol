# AYUDA Protocol 🛡️

## 📌 Project Overview

AYUDA Protocol is a decentralized identity and resource distribution system designed for institutional environments.

It solves transparency and accountability issues in aid distribution using NFC-based Proof-of-Presence and blockchain verification.

### Target Users

Government agencies and public institutions in the Philippines that manage subsidy and financial assistance programs, including national and local government units responsible for distributing aid to citizens. These systems are typically used for various subsidy types such as education assistance, healthcare aid, emergency relief, and livelihood support programs.

For the current real-world context, the primary focus is on oil subsidy programs for public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers (jeepney, tricycle, and bus drivers). These beneficiaries depend on daily income and are directly affected by fuel price increases. However, they often face long queues, manual verification delays, and inconsistent distribution when claiming subsidies.

AYUDA Protocol is also built for administrators and government staff who handle aid distribution, where transparency, auditability, and fraud prevention are critical. Traditional systems often struggle with duplicate records, missing beneficiaries, and lack of real-time tracking.

With AYUDA Protocol, both sides benefit: drivers receive faster and fairer access to subsidies, while government institutions gain a fully transparent, blockchain-verified system that can scale across all types of government aid programs, starting with oil subsidies as the most immediate and relevant use case.

### The Problem

Every day, especially in rural provinces and city centers in the Philippines, oil subsidy drivers and public utility drivers are forced to line up for hours—sometimes half a day—just to claim government fuel subsidies or aid distributions.

These long queues create major inefficiencies:

* Drivers lose valuable working time (income loss for the day)
* Crowded physical claiming centers cause delays and confusion
* Manual verification leads to duplication, errors, and favoritism
* Some eligible drivers are turned away due to incomplete lists or system mismatches
* Lack of transparency makes it unclear who has already received aid
* Manual aid distribution is prone to errors, ghost recipients, and lack of auditing.
* There is no transparency on unclaimed or unverified aid.
* Students struggle with wallets, blockchain complexity, and gas fees.
* Institutions cannot clearly track where funds go after allocation.

As a result, the subsidy meant to support drivers’ livelihood often becomes a burden instead of relief.

---

### The Solution

AYUDA Protocol removes the need for physical lining up by replacing manual distribution with a decentralized, NFC-based and blockchain-verified aid system built on Stellar.

With AYUDA Protocol:

* Each driver is pre-registered and verified as a legitimate beneficiary
* Drivers simply tap an NFC-enabled card or phone to prove presence
* Aid is instantly validated and released through a Soroban smart contract
* NFC cards act as secure physical identity verification.
* Every transaction is recorded on the Stellar blockchain.
* Proof-of-Presence ensures only verified students can claim aid.
* Institutions handle gas fees for a seamless experience.
* Every aid record is fully traceable on-chain.
* If aid remains unclaimed, funds are returned to the institution’s aid pool for future redistribution.
* Every transaction is recorded on-chain for full transparency and auditability
* No physical queues, no manual checking, and no favoritism

Instead of spending hours waiting in line, drivers receive their subsidy in seconds—securely, transparently, and directly to their wallet.

# Live site
#PS: this is outdate and im having issue with git but i have the video in the email i sent the demo of it working
the backend handles all signing for adding account and claiming so there are no pop ups

## 🏗 System Evolution & Demo

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment

The foundation of the AYUDA Protocol is deployed on the Stellar Testnet. This confirms that the Soroban smart contract is live, immutable, and publicly verifiable.

---

### 2. Local Protocol Testing

Before deployment, core functions such as `register_citizen`, `fund_aid`, and `claim_aid` were tested locally to ensure correct state handling, prevent duplicate entries, and validate secure aid logic.

---

### 3. On-Chain Verification (Explorer)

Every transaction is fully transparent and can be verified on the Stellar blockchain. This removes the “black box” problem in traditional aid systems.

### 4. Admin Management Dashboard

The admin dashboard connects NFC-based identity verification with blockchain records, allowing real-time monitoring of student registration and aid distribution.

### 5. Admin Management Dashboard

The admin dashboard serves as the central control system of the AYUDA Protocol, giving administrators full visibility over registration, claiming activity, and fund distribution in real time.

Through the dashboard, admins can monitor:

* Registered beneficiaries (drivers)
* Live claiming status (claimed, pending, or unclaimed)
* Blockchain-verified transaction history
* Total distributed aid vs remaining aid pool

Every action in the system is synced with the Stellar blockchain, ensuring that all records are immutable and auditable. This removes the possibility of hidden transactions, duplication, or manual manipulation.

Administrators also have control over aid allocation cycles. If funds remain unclaimed after a distribution period, the dashboard automatically flags them and returns the remaining balance to the institutional aid pool for redistribution.

The dashboard transforms traditional aid management into a transparent, real-time system where institutions can fully track, verify, and audit every transaction without relying on manual paperwork or intermediaries.

### 6. Claiming System (NFC-Based Aid Redemption)

The claiming system of AYUDA Protocol is designed to replace long physical queues with a fast, contactless, and secure verification process. Instead of manually signing lists or waiting for approval, drivers simply use their registered NFC card or NFC-enabled device to claim their subsidy.

When a driver taps their NFC tag at a designated claiming point, the system instantly verifies their identity and eligibility through the Stellar blockchain. Once confirmed, a Soroban smart contract automatically releases the aid directly to the driver’s wallet.

This process ensures that claiming is:

* Fast (completed in seconds)
* Secure (identity verified through NFC + blockchain)
* Transparent (every claim is recorded on-chain)
* Fair (only verified beneficiaries can receive aid)

If a driver is not eligible or has already claimed, the system automatically rejects the request, preventing duplicate or fraudulent claims.

Overall, the claiming system removes the need for physical queues and manual validation, making aid distribution faster and more reliable.
